FragmentVC: Any-to-Any Voice Conversion by End-to-End Extracting and Fusing Fine-Grained Voice Fragments With Attention.
 In this paper we proposed FragmentVC, in which the latent phonetic structure of the utterance from the source speaker is
 obtained from Wav2Vec 2.0, while the spectral features of the utterance(s) from the target speaker are obtained from log mel-spectrograms. 
By aligning the hidden structures of the two different feature spaces with a two-stage training process,
 FragmentVC is able to extract fine-grained voice fragments from the target speaker utterance(s) and fuse them into the desired utterance,
 all based on the attention mechanism of Transformer as verified with analysis on attention maps, and is accomplished end-to-end.
